                Also known as the national fruit of India, Mango is my favourite fruit.
                Although it may be seasonal, but the period its available for is enough for me.
                Mango can also be served as a dessert in the form of milkshake.
                There are many types of mangoes such as- chausa,totapuri,dasheri etc. 
                The best one being Alphonso.
                Mangoes are sweet and delicious and my favourite fruit to eat.
